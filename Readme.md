# Blockchain demos for International Talks

Project to demonstrate how we can build smart contracts, deploy on development environments, and interact with it through JavaScript.

Further details are on the projects root folder `Readme.md`.

## Projects

- [smart-contracts](https://github.com/thcerutti/demos-blockchain-intl-talks/tree/main/smart-contracts): Smart contracts are some piece of software that execute functions that are validated by blockchains. Here are two examples of smart contracts.

- [web-demos](https://github.com/thcerutti/demos-blockchain-intl-talks/tree/main/web-demos): a static website to demonstrate the interaction of the use to a smart contract, using [Web3 js lib](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/).

## Presentation roadmap

- Solidity
- Local deploy using Ganache
- Interact with contract on the local Ganache blockchain
- Show [RemixIDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Deploy smart contract on Sepolia Test Network
- Interact with smart contract deployed on [Sepolia Test Network](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xe1da1d3bd8e05a48b16316606233e745a7b95ea9)
